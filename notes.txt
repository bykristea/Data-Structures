What are the different operations we may want to do on data structures?
    - Access Values
    - Delete
    - Insert
    - Peek, Update
    - Search


    Class Node: has a 
        - Value
        - Next --> points to another Node that it links to 
        - Previous-->points to previous Node

        accessing values array vs linked list
        runtime for array O(1)
        runtime for Linked List O(n)

        inserting into a list array vs linked list
        runtime for array O(n)
        runtime for Linked List O(1)

        deleting into a list array vs linked list
        runtime for array: O(n)
        runtime for Linked List O(1) 

        searching array vs linked list
        runtime for array: O(n)
        runtime for Linked List: O(n)

    Linked List: pointers-->point to the next value forward. 
    Double Linked List:--> point forward and backward so next and previous value
        --what is my head and what is my tail?
        -Head First Node
        -Tail Last Node


Queue --> FIFO-> adding to the tail and removing from the head
Stack --> LIFO-> adding to the head and removing from the head


Array: Adding to the front or back: O(n)
Double Linked List adding O(1)
